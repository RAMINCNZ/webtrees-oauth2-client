## What are the benefits of this module?
+ The module provides single sign on ([SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on)) into the [webtrees](https://webtrees.net) application based on the [OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) standard.
+ A pre-configured set of authorization providers can be selected during webtrees login.
+ If choosing to sign on with an authorization provider, the user account data (i.e. user name, real name, email address) of the authorization provider is used for the user account in webtrees.

## IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
It is **highly recommended to use** the **HTTPS** protocol for your webtrees installation. The [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) protocol will ensure the encryption of the communication between webtrees and the authorization provider for a secure exchange of secret IDs and secret access tokens.

Please check whether your **webtrees BASE_URL** in the config.ini.php file **starts with "https"**, e.g. https://my_site.net/webtrees.

## Installation
+ Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Jefferson49/webtrees-oauth2-client/releases/latest) of the module
+ Copy the folder "oauth2_client" into the "module_v4" folder of your webtrees installation
+ Check if the module is activated in the control panel:
  + Login to webtrees as an administrator
	+ Go to "Control Panel/All Modules", and find the module called "ExtendedImportExport"
	+ Check if it has a tick for "Enabled"

## Supported Authorization Providers
The OAuth 2.0 Client for webtrees uses the OAuth 2.0 implementation of the [The League](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/), which allows developers to create OAuth 2.0 clients that interface with a wide-variety of OAuth 2.0 providers. Within this concept, The League supports serveral "[official providers](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/providers/league/)". As far as suitable for webtrees, these official providers were included, see list below. 

Currently, the following authorization providers are supported:
+ **Generic** (can be configured for several authorization providers)
+ **Github**
+ **Google**
+ **Joomla** (with a specific authorization provider extension installed in Joomla)
+ **WordPress** (with a specific authorization provider plugin installed in WordPress)

To use further authorization providers, the following approaches are available:
+ Use the Generic authorization provider, which can be adopted to a wide range of authorization providers.
+ There are a large number of [3rd party provider clients](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/providers/thirdparty/) available, which follow the same software structure and interfaces from [The League](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/). The code of the OAuth 2.0 Client for webtrees allows to flexibly integrate further members of this set of provider clients. You can file a [feature request](#bugs-and-feature-requests), if you are interested in a specific provider.

## Configuration of Authorization Providers
### General Configuration
In general, the following steps need to be taken to configure an authorization provider:
+ Login on the provider web page
+ Register an OAuth2 app (or web app)
+ Provide the **redirect URL** (or callback URL) from webtrees (see description/screenshot below) to the registered app.
+ Get the **client ID** for the registered app
+ Get (or generate) the **client secret** for the registered app
+ Enter the client ID and client secret into your webtrees configuratin file (config.ini.php)

In order to get the redirect URL, open the module settings in the control panel and copy the shown value.

## Mapping of the User Data to webtrees
The user data (i.e. user name, real name, email address), which is received with the OAuth 2.0 protocol from the authorization provider, is mapped to a webtrees user. Since there might be differences regarding availablility and changability of the user data, the following mapping is used:
+ **primary**: The primary key of the user data within the authorization provider. The primary key **cannot be changed** within webtrees and usually also cannot be changed within the authorization provider. If the primary key within the authorization provider is changed by any means, this will result in loosing the link of the user data between webtrees and the authorization provider.
+ **mandatory**: A mandatory part of the user data, which can only be changed within the authorization provider and is not allowed to be changed within webtrees. Mandatory parts of the user data **are updated** in webtrees if changed within the authorization provider.
+ **optional**: An optional part of the user data, which can be changed within webtrees. Optional user data will not be updated/synchronized between the authorization provider and webtrees.

The following table shows the mapping of the user data for the different authorization providers:

|Authorization provider|user name|real name|email address|
|:---------------------|:--------|:--------|:------------|
|Generic|mandatory|optional|primary|
|Github|primary|optional|mandatory|
|Google|optional|optional|primary|
|Joomla|primary|optional|mandatory|
|WordPress|primary|optional|mandatory|

## Definitions 
[RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) defines several roles, which are used in OAuth. In the context of the OAuth 2.0 Client and webtrees single sign on, the OAuth [roles](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.1) and definitions are used as follows:
+ **Resource Owner**: The webtrees user.
+ **Ressource**: The user data (e.g. user name, real name, email address, ...), which belong to the webtrees user while using a 3rd party webservice (e.g. Github, Google, Joomla).
+ **Client**: The webtrees application used in a web browser.
+ **Authorization Provider**: A 3rd party web application, which usually provides the "Authorization Server", the "Ressource Server", and the "User Authentification" in one entity.
+ **Authorization Server**: A part of the Authorization Provider, which is issuing access tokens to  webtrees after successfully authenticating the webtrees user.
+ **Ressource Server**: A part of the Authorization Provider, which is responding the protected user data (e.g. user name, real name, email address) on requests with authenticated access tokens.
+ **User Authentification**: A part of the Authorization Provider, which is providing 3rd party user login and authentification.

## Concept
+ "OAuth (short for open authorization) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords." \[[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)\].
+ The "OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service [...] on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service" \[[RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)\].
+ The OAuth 2.0 standard is specified in [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749).
+ The OAuth 2.0 Client for webtrees uses the OAuth2 implementation of the [League/oauth2-client](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/) by configuring/using it with the code as described in [basic usage](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/usage/) of the League/oauth2-client.
+ The OAuth 2.0 Client for webtrees requests the user data (i.e. user name, real name, email address) from the authorization provider.
+ After submitting a request to login with an authorization provider, the user will be redirected to a website with the authorizaton provider's user authentification.
+ With the login at the authorization provider, the user (Resource Owner) confirms to use the user data (Ressource) from the authorization provider in webtrees. Some authorizaton providers (e.g. Google) explicitly request to confirm the usage of the user data. Others (e.g. Github) provide access by simply login.

### Protocol Flow
The following figure shows how the protocol flow of [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) is implemented. For further descriptions of the protocol flow, please refer to the following chapters of [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and the description of the [League/OAuth2 Client](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/):
+ [OAuth 2 Protocol Flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.2)
+ [Authorization Code Grant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)
+ [League/OAuth2 Client](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/)
